Git's architecture is designed to be efficient, flexible, and handle changes in projects. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

**Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):** Unlike some version control systems, Git is a DVCS. This means each developer has a complete copy of the repository on their machine. This allows them to work offline and collaborate effectively.

**Three-stage Architecture:** Git uses a three-stage workflow for managing changes:

1. **Working Directory:** This is your local folder structure where you make changes to the project files.
2. **Staging Area (Index):** This is a temporary holding area where you select specific changes you want to include in your next commit.
3. **Repository (Local Repository):** This is the heart of Git. It stores the entire project history, including all file changes and commits. It's a hidden folder typically named `.git`.

**Data Storage:**  Git stores information in a specific way:

* **Objects:** Git stores project data as a collection of objects like blobs (raw file content), trees (directory structure), commits (snapshots of project state with metadata), and tags (references to specific commits).
* **SHA-1 Hashing:** Each object is assigned a unique identifier based on its content using a cryptographic hash function (SHA-1). This ensures data integrity and efficient storage.

**Branching and Merging:**  A powerful feature of Git is its branching capability. Developers can create isolated branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project line. When ready, they can merge their changes back into the main branch.
